# TaskBoardApp

A simple ASP.NET Core MVC project for managing tasks. Only registered users can see the boards with tasks with them. Tasks are assigned to users and a user can edit and delete his tasks, but cannot edit or delete tasks for other users.

Made as an exercise for the course ASP.NET Core Fundamentals in SoftUni.
